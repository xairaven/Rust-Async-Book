# "Asynchronous Programming in Rust"
**by Rust-Lang Team & Rust Community**<br>

Repository for learning asynchronous programming in Rust using exercises and examples from the **Rust Async Book**.<br>
This repository contains my implementations, notes, and experiments as I dive into Rust's async-await syntax,
exploring its practical applications and building foundational knowledge in asynchronous programming paradigms.<br>

If you find anything incorrect you can create an issue or open a pull request.<br>

These are my personal solutions, so only corrections are accepted. Solutions to missing exercises are not needed! <br>

**Status:** *Done (13.07.2024)*
